# Installing

===

Installing Bugzilla-OpenID is quite simple.

 * Copy Bugzilla-OpenID into your extensions folder.
 * Run ./install-module.pl Net::OpenID::Consumer to install the OpenID consumer.
 * Run ./checksetup.pl to ensure that the correct tables are generated.
 * Configure and enjoy!

## Dependencies

 * You'd need the GMP library in order to build Crypt::DH::GMP
   (needed by Net::OpenID::Consumer) from CPAN.
